# Tech-image-classifier
![classfy1.png](classfy1.png)
### This is an end to end image classification project. </br>
#### In this data science and machine learning project, we classify Tech personalities. We restrict classification to only 7 people,
1. Elon Musk
2. Jeff Bezoz
3. Larry Ellison
4. Marissa Mayer
5. Satya Nandella
6. Steve Jobs
7. Sundar Pichai

It uses a pretrained model. The project involves web scraping to get the images from the internet. </br>
The user drags and drops and drops (selects) the image of one of the listed tech figures and the model is able to identify the person.</br>
If the model is not able to predict the face, it throws a face-mismatch message.</br>
### Technologies used in this project.
1. Python
2. Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
