### This is an end to end image classification project. </br>
It uses a pretrained model. The project involves web scraping to get the images from the internet. </br>
The user drags and drops and drops (selects) the image of one of the listed tech figures and the model is able to identify the person.</br>
If the model is not able to predict the face, it throws a face-mismatch message.</br>
